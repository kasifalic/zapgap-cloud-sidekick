      solution: "ZapGap was configured to monitor the service and detect the early warning signs of the memory leak. Upon detection of high memory usage, ZapGap's auto-remediation workflow kicked in: it safely restarted the affected service, cleared caches, and even notified the team on Slack of the action taken. All of this happened within seconds of the anomaly.",

For example, a developer messages ZapGap: 'Create a new QA environment for the payment service.' ZapGap verifies the request against policy, then proceeds to provision a standardized environment.
